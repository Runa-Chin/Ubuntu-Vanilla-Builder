# Build your own Ubuntu Vanilla with more customization and more lighter than OG's Ubuntu

![Screnshoot of Ubuntu Vanilla](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runa-Chin/Ubuntu-Vanilla-Builder/main/image/vanilla-gnome-ubuntu.png)

## Greetings first!

Welcome to the Ubuntu Vanilla Builder repository. This repository is home for tutorials on how to build ISOs for Ubuntu Vanilla installations or Providing Shell automation code to make it easier for users to build ISOs for Ubuntu Vanilla installations (coming soon for code).

First, I'd like to explain that I was inspired by the repository created by [**Marcos Tischer Vallim**][credits] and that prompted me to create my own version with customizations for the current versions, both LTS which is a two-year release and Devel which is a rolling-release version of Ubuntu.

Please note, this repository is available on both GitHub and Codeberg and is maintained by the Authors below. For automation code, coming soon. This time we will bring the documentation first. And don't be confused, the documentation on GitHub is specific to the Devel edition or the rolling release edition of Ubuntu. For LTS editions, [***please refer to this repository over at Codeberg***][codbrg].

## Authors 

- [**Runa Inoue Anderson**][runa-chin] as Lead Developer and Documentations for Devel build (on GitHub).
- [**James "Jim" Ed Randson**][jimed] as Code Committer, Vice Lead Developer, Documentations (on Codeberg), and Tester.

## Where the docs ?

You can read an docs or tutorial how to do it in Wiki sections.
### [**Go to WIki sections to read our docs/tutorial**](https://github.com/Runa-Chin/Ubuntu-Vanilla-Builder/wiki)

### **Coming Soon** for code. For these times, read a docs/tutorial first. We will delete this section is code are ready to deploy it.
