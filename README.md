# Build your own Ubuntu Vanilla with more customization and more lighter than OG's Ubuntu

## Greetings first!

Welcome to the Ubuntu Vanilla Builder repository. This repository is home to tutorials on how to build ISOs for Ubuntu Vanilla installations as well as Shell automation code to make it easier for users to build ISOs for Ubuntu Vanilla installations (coming soon for code).

First, I'd like to explain that I was inspired by the repository created by [Marcos Tischer Vallim][credits] and that prompted me to create my own version with customizations for the current versions, both LTS which is a two-year release and Devel which is a rolling-release version of Ubuntu.
